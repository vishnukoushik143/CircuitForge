This is a small project implemented in python notebook to realize the circuits for Foster and Cauer Forms Given the Network Function in Laplace Domain.
This is part of Network Analysis and Synthesis course that I have taken in third semester of my undergrad studies.

It takes Laplace Domain Transfer Function and synthesizes the circuit Foster-I, Foster-II, Cauer-I or Cauer-II forms. 
SymPy Library is used to check the input function and extract required coefficients from the input function.
